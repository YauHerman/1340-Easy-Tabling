# Easy Tabling

The goal of this program is to create an efficient yet user-friendly table management system.

This table management system aims to help small-scale restaurants in Hong Kong. As they often have limited amount of tables and waiters due to high rental and salary cost, it is important for them to maximize their productivity in order to survive in a competitive market.
This program automate the table management process effectively so that waiters can focus on serving customers.
